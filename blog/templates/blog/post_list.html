                No, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out. Bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together. Stare at ceiling fall asleep upside-down so licks your face yet unwrap toilet paper. Cry louder at reflection lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap yet lies down meowzer run in circles experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo.
